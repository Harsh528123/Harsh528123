# About Me

Hi everyone! My name is Harsh Kothari and currently I am currently a second year Software Engineering student at the University of Alberta. 

Currently, I am learning about interactive web development through the “Web Design For Everybody” set of 5 courses offered by the University of Michigan through Coursera.

I recently finished the “Python for Everybody” set of 5 courses also offered by the University of Michigan through Coursera. 

Along with learning, I try to apply my skills through some various projects seen through my other repositories. 

Outside of the world of coding, I enjoy weight lifting, playing basketball and keeping myself up to date with financial news revolving around the US and Canada.
