# About Me

Hi everyone! My name is Harsh Kothari and currently I am currently a second year Software Engineering student at the University of Alberta. 

I completed the Python for Everybody specialization from University of Michigan issued by Coursera and also completed three courses from the Web Design for Everbody specialization
from University of Michigan issued by Coursera. I recently learned SQL from The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero from Udemy. 

Along with learning, I try to apply my skills through some various projects, many of which are on GitHub. Feel free to take a look at the projects :)

Outside of the world of coding, I enjoy weight lifting, playing basketball and keeping myself up to date with technology news revolving around the US and Canada.
