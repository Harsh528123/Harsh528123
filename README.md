# About Me

Hi everyone! My name is Harsh Kothari and currently I am currently a Software Engineering student of the graduating class of 2025 at the University of Alberta. 

I currently am working as an NSERC USRA research assistant working on a adaptive learning project from Athabasca University. More specifically, I am designing a question bank management system with adaptive learning capatiblities using React, Node.js and MySQL. 

Along with working, I try to apply my skills through some various projects, many of which are on GitHub. Feel free to take a look at the projects :)

Outside of the world of coding, I enjoy weight lifting, playing basketball and keeping myself up to date with technology news revolving around the US and Canada.
